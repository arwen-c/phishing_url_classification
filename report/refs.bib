    abstract = {Due to the rapid growth of the Internet, users change their preference from traditional shopping to the electronic commerce. Instead of bank/shop robbery, nowadays, criminals try to find their victims in the cyberspace with some specific tricks. By using the anonymous structure of the Internet, attackers set out new techniques, such as phishing, to deceive victims with the use of false websites to collect their sensitive information such as account IDs, usernames, passwords, etc. Understanding whether a web page is legitimate or phishing is a very challenging problem, due to its semantics-based attack structure, which mainly exploits the computer users’ vulnerabilities. Although software companies launch new anti-phishing products, which use blacklists, heuristics, visual and machine learning-based approaches, these products cannot prevent all of the phishing attacks. In this paper, a real-time anti-phishing system, which uses seven different classification algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) based features, is proposed. The system has the following distinguishing properties from other studies in the literature: language independence, use of a huge size of phishing and legitimate data, real-time execution, detection of new websites, independence from third-party services and use of feature-rich classifiers. For measuring the performance of the system, a new dataset is constructed, and the experimental results are tested on it. According to the experimental and comparative results from the implemented classification algorithms, Random Forest algorithm with only NLP based features gives the best performance with the 97.98% accuracy rate for detection of phishing URLs.}

In this paper, we proposed a machine learning based anti-phishing system (i.e., named as PHISH-SAFE) based on Uniform Resource Locator (URL) features. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we have taken 14 features from URL to detect a website as a phishing or non-phishing. The proposed system is trained using more than 33,000 phishing and legitimate URLs with SVM and Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifiers. Our experiment results show more than 90{\%} accuracy in detecting phishing websites using SVM classifier.",

    abstract = {Blacklists play a vital role in protecting internet users against phishing attacks. The effectiveness of blacklists depends on their size, scope, update speed and frequency, and accuracy - among other characteristics. In this paper we present a measurement study that analyses 3 key phishing blacklists: Google Safe Browsing (GSB), OpenPhish (OP), and PhishTank (PT). We investigate the uptake, dropout, typical lifetimes, and overlap of URLs in these blacklists. During our 75-day measurement period we observe that GSB contains, on average, 1.6 million URLs, compared to 12,433 in PT and 3,861 in OP. We see that OP removes a significant proportion of its URLs after 5 and 7 days, with none remaining after 21 days - potentially limiting the blacklist’s effectiveness. We observe fewer URLs residing in all 3 blacklists as time-since-blacklisted increases – suggesting that phishing URLs are often short-lived. None of the 3 blacklists enforce a one-time-only URL policy - therefore protecting users against reoffending phishing websites. Across all 3 blacklists, we detect a significant number of URLs that reappear within 1 day of removal – perhaps suggesting premature removal or re-emerging threats. Finally, we discover 11,603 unique URLs residing in both PT and OP – a 12\% overlap. Despite its smaller average size, OP detected over 90\% of these overlapping URLs before PT did.},
